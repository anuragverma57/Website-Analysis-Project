# Website Analysis Project

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing website data to understand user behavior, traffic patterns, and performance insights. It uses Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## 💡 Motivation

I built this project to strengthen my data analysis skills and to connect my backend development experience with data-driven insights. It also helped me practice working with real-world data in a structured way.

## 🧑‍🏫 What I Learned

* Cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets
* Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
* Visualizing traffic trends and engagement patterns
* Deriving insights that can improve website performance

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anuragverma57/Website-Analysis-Project.git
   cd Website-Analysis-Project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

and open the analysis notebook to explore step by step.
